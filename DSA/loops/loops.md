**LOOPS**

- Loops helps us in repeating a task again and again .
- **Loops in JavaScript are used to reduce repetitive tasks by repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This makes code more concise and efficient.**


1. **FOR LOOP**
   - The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

2. **WHILE LOOP**
   - The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

3. **DO-WHILE LOOP**
   - The do-while loop is similar to while loop except it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

4. **FOR-IN LOOP**
   - The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It only iterate over keys of an object which have their enumerable property set to “true”.

5. **FOR-OF LOOP**
   - The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or sets. It directly iterate the value and has more concise syntax than for loop.

NOTE :-

- Use for loop when the number of iterations is known.
- Use while loop when the condition depends on dynamic factors.
- Use do-while loop to ensure the block executes at least once.
- Use for...in loop to iterate over object properties.
- Use for...of loop for iterating through iterable objects.
