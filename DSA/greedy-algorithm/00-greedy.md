# Greedy Algorithm

**Greedy is a problem solving approach where we make locally optimal choices , with a hope that it will lead us to the global optimal solution .**

**Take best choice at the moment , without worrying about the future .**

### Types of Problems :-

1. Optimization Problems ( min / max result )
   1. Activity selection / interval scheduling .
   2. Fractional knapsack .
   3. Job sequencing with deadlines .
   
2. Graph Problems 
   1. MST ( Minimum spanning tree ) -> kruskal's / Prim's Algo .
   2. Shortest path .
   
3. Scheduling Problems 
   1. CPU scheduling ( shortest first ) .
   
4. Game / Puzzle and much more .


### Greedy Problem Hints :-
 1. Max number of ...
 2. Min cost / max Profit ...
 3. Schedule / allocate / assign efficiently .
 4. Shortest / Smallest / Largest / Longest .
 5. Non - overlapping intervals .
